The Odin Project -> HTML Fundamentals -> Project: Recipes

I'm going to work on a proper website now. I'm going to be using the HTML skills I've gained so far, along with some CSS I as well. We'll see.

(undocumented commit) Corrected the spelling of the word "recipes" from "recipies"

(after finishing) Noice. Moving on.
